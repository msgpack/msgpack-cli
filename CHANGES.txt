Release 0.1 - 2011/1/4

  Porting from Message Pack Java 0.3.

  FEATURES
  * MessagePackObject is implemented.
  * Packer APIs (Packer class) are implemented.
  * Buffered Unpacker APIs (Unpacker class) are implemented.
  * Unbuffered Unpacker APIs (Unpacking class) are implemented.

Release 0.2 - 2012/6/19

  FEATURES
  * Geneneric Serializer is implemented. (See MessagePackSerializer.Create<T>().)
  * Redesign basic APIs.
  * Support Mono, Silverlight, WP 7.1 (experimental).
  * RPC (See https://github.com/yfakariya/msgpack-rpc-cli/)

Release 0.3 - 2013/1/27

  BREAKING CHANGES
  * Unpacker.Feed is removed. Use Unpacker.Create(Stream) and feed data to the passing Stream instead of Unpacker.
  * IUnpackable.UnpackFromMessage now takes Unpacker instead of MessagePackObject to be symmetric as IPackable and improve custom unpacking performance.
  * Unpacker.Create() is removed because it is completely useless.
  * Unpacker does not remember interruptted stream state now. So, unpacker throws exception when it reaches end of stream. 
    Data feeding should be handled on the underlying stream layer like NetworkStream does -- it is not unpacker layer's responsibility.

  FEATURES
  * Improve protobuf-net compatibility.
  * Add non-generic overload for MessagePackSerializer.Create().
  * Add direct read method for primitive types on Unpacker. It enable dramatic performance improvement on deserializer.
  * Support WinRT (experimental, .NET Fx core only, that is, WinMD is not supported yet).
  * Add SerialializerGenerator which provides capability to generate pre-built serializer assembly.
  * Unpacker.ReadItem/UnpackSubtree makes easy to unpack collection as MessagePackObject.

  IMPROVEMENTS
  * Improve unpacking performance.

  BUG FIXES
  * Fix 'sparse' declaration (i.e. field ids are not continuous on the objects' MessagePackDataMember attribute) causes deserialization error.
  * Fix synchronization related error.
  * Serializers respects IPackable/IUnpackable.

Release 0.3.1 - 2013/5/4

  FEATURES
  * [issue1] Add byte-array based serialization APIs.

  BUG FIXES
  * [issue6] Fix deserializing from a map which contains unknown member causes MessageTypeException.

Release 0.3.2 - 2013/6/30

  FEATURES
  * Support safe deserialization for the stream which contains new types of MsgPack spec.
    see https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md for details.

  BUG FIXES
  * Fix infinite loop for invalid stream which header is Raw and it does not have enough length contents.

Release 0.3.2.1 - 2013/8/17

  BUG FIXES
  * Fix Unpacker.ReadString/ReadBinary of subtree unpacker leads to subsequent unpacking failure when unpacked value is nil or empty.

Release 0.4 - 2013/10/6

  BREAKING CHANGES
  * Packer.PackRaw(IEnumerable<byte>) can emit compact binary when the IEnumerable<byte> object also implements ICollection<byte> or ICollection.
  * There are little issues in corner cases.
    * Unpacker.Data never returns null even if it is in before head of underlying stream.
    * MessagePackSerializer<T>.UnpackFrom does not throw exception when unpacker is still in before head of the underlying stream. Note that generated serializer still require that the unpacker is in head of the underlying array or map.

  FEATURES
  * Support binary types, string8 types, and extension types of MsgPack spec.
    see https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack/blob/master/spec.md for details.
  * SerializerGenerator now enable to specify output directory.
  * Specify default collection types for well-known abstract collection types (IList<T>, IDictionary<TKey,TValue>, etc.).

  BUG FIXES
  * Fix SerializerGenerator only support one serealizer per assembly.
  * Fix UTC DateTime serialization is corrupt in Mono.
  * Fix Boolean? unpacking is not implemented.
  * Fix bugs of NilImplication.

  NOTE
  * Nullable<MessagePack> based unpacker API is deprecated becaue of their poor performance. You should use fast non-nullable APIs instead (properties/methods with 'Data' suffixes).
  * This version is tested on .NET 4.5 and Mono 2.10.8.1.
